-dating app where you fill out a survey and find your best match! technologies/libraries will include, javascript, heroku, express

-the survey is not very pretty forgive my lack of front end competance at the moment those dropdowns shold toggle but i currently just have the display feature always on becausei was running into an error where the drop downs were never showing up. (removed 'display: none')

-the program's compatibility logic is working, your best match will be calculated, you will have to input a few friends, but you'll find that the app will show you your closest match. it will calculate the compatibility scores. if i push it to heroku the data would be saved. you just have to enter a few friends and you will see that data is being stored in api/friends and the console will tell you your closest match. honestly i got a little overwhelmed with tying together all the files. to complete this project I would need some more javascript to display the closest match's picture as a pop up. I am close, I just didn't get the last pieces together, but I'm very determined to figure those steps out in project 2.
