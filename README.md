# FriendFinder
dating app where you fill out a survey and find your best match! technologies/libraries will include, javascript, heroku, express

the survey is not very pretty forgive my lack of front end competance at the moment those dropdowns shold toggle but i currently just have the display feature always on becausei was running into an error where the drop downs were never showing up.

the program is somewhat working, your best match will be calculated, you will have to input a few friends, but you'll find that the app will show you your closest match in the console, well, the cli, heh..
